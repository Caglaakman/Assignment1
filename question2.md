# Question 2

**Q2.** Assign variables to the individual components of your favourite gene (e.g promoter, 5' UTR,
start codon, exon1, intron, exon2, stop codon, 3' UTR). Print the entire gene by using the string
concatenation operator on the standard output ! 

'''

promoter = "TTAAATTATAAATTTTTAAAAAAA"
5'_prime_UTR = AAAATTTGGGGGGGGGGG
start_codon = "ATG"
exon1 = "GCATGAAATGGGTACACA"
intron = "GGGGGGGGTTTTT"
2exon = "ACGCGACAAATGACA"
stop_codon = "TGA"
3_prime_UTR = "TTTTTTTTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAÃ©

my_fav_gene = promoter + 5'_prime_UTR + start_codon + exon1 + intron + 2exon + stop_codon + 3_prime_UTR


print("My favourite gene sequence is as follows:")
print(my_fav_gene)
